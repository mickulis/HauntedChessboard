HIGH PRIORITY:

    HELP        // ehh...
    End game screen     // placeholders for now
    Hints button toggle effect



MID PRIORITY:

    UI layout improvements
    Unify chess pieces variables in model   // no CHESSPIECES variables in model, enum doesn't have to be serialized
        Could be better done with CHESSPIECES 2D array in the first place, but too much effort...
    Improve hints   // I think they are good enough now
        Maybe use different colors for different values
    Add hints for marked tiles
        Maybe put numbers on tiles  // DONE




LOW PRIORITY:

    better focus tile visual
    show tiles attacked by each piece
    show piece attack range
    drag & drop
    algorithm for setting the victory tiles up
