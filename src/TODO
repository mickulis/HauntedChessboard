HIGH PRIORITY:

    End game screen     // placeholders for now



MID PRIORITY:

    UI layout improvements
    Unify chess pieces variables in model   // no CHESSPIECES variables in model, enum doesn't have to be serialized
        Could be better done with CHESSPIECES 2D array in the first place, but too much effort...


LOW PRIORITY:

    better focus tile visual
    show tiles attacked by each piece
    show piece attack range
    drag & drop
    algorithm for setting the victory tiles up
